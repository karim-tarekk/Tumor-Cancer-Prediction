# Tumor-Cancer-Prediction

**Cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and its early detection is critical for effective treatment and increased survival rates. This project aims to automate the cancer detection process by analyzing a variety of patient-specific features and leveraging machine learning techniques to provide rapid and reliable assessments.**


In this project, Different classification models will be used to detect Tumor Cancer.

#### Dataset: The dataset contains a list of 455 patient with 30 feature and label with "B" or "M".


### The steps will go as follows:
1. Apply the required data cleaning methods and data preprocessing techniques.
2. Implement different classification models to investigate the performance of each classifier for detect Tumor Cancer.
3. Show classification Report for each model.


#### Used classification models:
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Logistic Regression (logit)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
